A brief update:
[Jiri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jp7hKlAAAAAJ) and I have been working through the new book [_High-Dimensional Probability: A Non-Asymptotic Viewpoint_ by Martin E. Wainwright](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/highdimensional-statistics/8A91ECEEC38F46DAB53E9FF8757C7A4E), which has been really good so far.
In the process, we have produced solutions for a subset of the exercises. 
Since some of the exercises are considerably challenging, we have decided to publicly post our worked solutions.
[Check it out!](https://high-dimensional-probability.github.io/)
