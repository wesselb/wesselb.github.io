The [Cambridge Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) is launching [a blog](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/blog), featuring a first [two](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/blog/2021/03/31/what-keeps-a-bayesian-awake-at-night-part-1.html)-[part](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/blog/2021/03/31/what-keeps-a-bayesian-awake-at-night-part-2.html) post about what keeps a Bayesian awake at night.
In the [first part](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/blog/2021/03/31/what-keeps-a-bayesian-awake-at-night-part-1.html), during day time, we lay out the standard arguments that many use to support Bayesian inference, ranging from more fundamental theorems, like Cox's theorem, to unit tests, like Wald's theorem.
In the [second part](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/blog/2021/03/31/what-keeps-a-bayesian-awake-at-night-part-2.html), at night time, we take a closer look at these standard arguments and identify the weaknesses which cause Bayesians to lose sleep at night: the standard justifications have problems, modelling is hard and sensitive to innocolous details, and---worst of all---one typically must resort to approximate inference.
