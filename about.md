Hey, üëãüèº! My name is Wessel.
I am a PhD student at the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Dr Richard Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/Turner), and a member of Christ's College.
Previously, I was a machine learning researcher for [Invenia Labs](https://invenialabs.co.uk); they solve problems in the fields of machine learning, finance, electricity systems and markets, and complex systems.
Even before that, I was an electrical engineer for the [TU Delft Solar Boat Team](http://www.solarboatteam.nl/). 

I hold an MPhil in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](http://www.mlsalt.eng.cam.ac.uk/) from the University of Cambridge and a BSc in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/bachelors/ee/bachelor-of-electrical-engineering/) from the University of Delft.
My curriculum vitae can be found [here](/assets/cv.pdf).

My research interests include probabilistic modelling with a focus on time series, Bayesian nonparametrics with a focus on Gaussian processes, approximate inference, probabilistic programming, probability theory, and real analysis.
