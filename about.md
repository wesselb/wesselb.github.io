Hey, üëãüèº!
My name is Wessel.
I am currently a Senior Researcher on the [AI for Science initiative at Microsoft Research Amsterdam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai-for-science/).
The mission of the AI for Science initiative is to apply the full breadth of machine learning to develop new tools for scientific discovery.
My team does research into foundation models for atmospheric modelling. 
We developed [the Aurora model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13063), and recently released an [open-source version of the model](https://github.com/microsoft/aurora) too.

I hold a PhD in Machine from the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Dr Richard Turner](https://rich-turner-group.github.io/),
an MPhil in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) from the University of Cambridge,
and a BSc in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/electrical-engineering/bsc-electrical-engineering) from the University of Delft.
My curriculum vitae can be found [here](/assets/cv.pdf).

My research interests include machine learning for environmental science and forecasting,
probabilistic modelling with a focus on time series,
Bayesian nonparametrics with a focus on Gaussian processes,
approximate inference,
probabilistic programming,
probability theory,
and real analysis.
