Hey, üëãüèº! My name is Wessel.
I am a PhD student at the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Dr Richard Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/Turner), and a member of Christ's College.
Previously, I was a machine learning researcher for [Invenia Labs](https://invenialabs.co.uk); they solve problems in the fields of machine learning, finance, electricity systems and markets, and complex systems.
Even before that, I was an electrical engineer for the [TU Delft Solar Boat Team](http://www.solarboatteam.nl/). 

I hold an MPhil in Machine Learning, Speech, and Language Technology from the University of Cambridge and a BSc in Electrical Engineering from the University of Delft.
My curriculum vitae can be found [here](/assets/cv.pdf).

My research interests include probabilistic modelling, with a focus on Gaussian processes, approximate inference, and signal processing.
