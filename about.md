Hey, üëãüèº!
My name is Wessel.
I am currently a Senior Researcher on the [AI4Science initiative at Microsoft Research Amsterdam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai4science/).
The mission of the AI4Science initiative is to apply the full breadth of machine learning to develop new tools for scientific discovery.
Previously, I was a Machine Learning Researcher for [Invenia Labs](https://invenialabs.co.uk).
Invenia Labs uses machine learning to perform virtual trading in electricity markets with the goal of reducing emissions.
Even earlier, I was an electrical engineer for the [TU Delft Solar Boat Team](http://www.solarboatteam.nl/). 

I hold a PhD in Machine from the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Dr Richard Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/Turner),
an MPhil in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](http://www.mlsalt.eng.cam.ac.uk/) from the University of Cambridge,
and a BSc in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/bachelors/ee/bachelor-of-electrical-engineering/) from the University of Delft.
My curriculum vitae can be found [here](/assets/cv.pdf).

My research interests include probabilistic modelling with a focus on time series, Bayesian nonparametrics with a focus on Gaussian processes, approximate inference, probabilistic programming, probability theory, and real analysis.
