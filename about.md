Hey, üëãüèº!
My name is Wessel.
I am currently a Research Lead for the [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/).
Our team's goal is to advance environmental forecasting with end-to-end machine learning.
I am also a Quantative Researcher for [Cedalion Capital](https://cedalion.com/).
Previously, I was a Senior Researcher on the [AI for Science initiative at Microsoft Research Amsterdam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai-for-science/).
We developed [the Aurora model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09005-y) and [open sourced the model](https://github.com/microsoft/aurora) too.

I hold a PhD in Machine from the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Dr Richard Turner](https://rich-turner-group.github.io/),
an MPhil in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) from the University of Cambridge,
and a BSc in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/electrical-engineering/bsc-electrical-engineering) from the University of Delft.
My curriculum vitae can be found [here](/assets/cv.pdf).

My research interests include machine learning for environmental science and forecasting,
probabilistic modelling with a focus on time series,
Bayesian nonparametrics with a focus on Gaussian processes,
approximate inference,
probabilistic programming,
probability theory,
and real analysis.
